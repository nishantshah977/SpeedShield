# Features

SpeedShield is a configuration file used by Apache web servers to modify server settings and improve website performance. The file contains a series of directives that help to:

* Compress text, html, javascript, css, xml: This section enables compression for various types of files, which reduces their file size and speeds up their download time for users.

* Remove server signature: This directive removes server signature information that could be used by attackers to determine the version of the server software running on the server.

* Remove ETags: This directive disables the ETag response header, which can also be used to identify server information.

* Enable browser caching: This section sets expiration times for specific file types, allowing the user's browser to cache them and reduce the amount of requests to the server.

* Minify CSS and JavaScript files: This section compresses CSS and JavaScript files by removing any white space and unnecessary code.

* Minify HTML: This section compresses HTML files.

* Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: This directive sets the X-XSS-Protection header to help protect against XSS attacks.

* Prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks: This directive sets the X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options headers to protect against CSRF attacks.

* Protect against HTTP request smuggling attacks: This directive sets the Transfer-Encoding header to prevent HTTP request smuggling attacks.

* Secure cookie handling: This directive modifies the Set-Cookie header to add the HttpOnly and Secure flags to cookies.

* Serve images in next-gen formats: This section uses mod_rewrite to check if the user's browser accepts the WebP image format and serves them instead of JPEG or PNG images.

* Reduce unused CSS: This section uses mod_rewrite to check if the URL contains ".css" and if it does not contain the query string "no-min". If both conditions are met, the ".css" file is redirected to a ".min.css" file.

* Eliminate render-blocking resources: This section sets the Cache-Control header for certain file types to improve the performance of the website.
